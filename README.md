# Smell_Recognition

The goal of this project is to develop an algorithm capable of recognizing odors from encephalogram data of the brain.

The first part consist in building the datas from a encephalogram device.

Then, the second part will focuse on transforming the datas to make it more flexible and lighter.

The final step is to develop the algorithm that will recognize the smell from the datas made in the first part and transform in the second.
